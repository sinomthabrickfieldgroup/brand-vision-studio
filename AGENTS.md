- Keep shared site navigation and footer in the root route using the site-shell module so every public page has consistent navigation.
- Use the shared CaseStudy component for property detail pages so project narratives and enquiry links remain consistent.
- Contact enquiries go through the EnquiryForm and the submitEnquiry server function in src/lib/enquiry.ts. Delivery is mocked until Resend or Plunk is wired up; keep ENQUIRY_DELIVERY_LIVE false (the form then tells visitors to email directly) until it really sends.
- Property content lives in src/lib/portfolio.ts and every image slot in src/lib/media.ts; property pages render through CaseStudy at /portfolio/$slug.
- The first-visit loading screen lives in src/components/site-loader.tsx; EditorialMotion waits for its bf:loaded event before page motion starts.
- Enhance page motion through EditorialMotion at the root using IntersectionObserver and the Web Animations API; keep content visible by default and skip motion for reduced-motion preferences.
